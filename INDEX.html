       <h1> "DIVIDE USING C" This is a simple C code
where a function named DIVIDE, with two parameters, returns the result.
In the first case, I passed with 10,2 as values and expected the result 5.
In the second case, I passed with 7,0, which would lead to a zero division Exception.
In the third case, I passed with 5,3 which means I would get a float value as a result because the 5 is not divisible by 3(not exactly) which leads to lots of precision values(maybe) though the function is named with the data type int.
